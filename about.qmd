# About the Data Science & Technology theme

The Data Science & Technology theme at the Institute for Transport Studies (ITS), University of Leeds brings together researchers working at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and transport systems.

Our mission is to develop methods and tools that improve transport planning, operations, and policy through better data, modelling, and technology.

Key focus areas include:

- Mobility data science and analytics
- Transport modelling and simulation
- Machine learning for transport applications
- Intelligent transport systems and automation
- Spatial data science and networks

We collaborate across the University and with external partners to ensure our research has academic rigor and real-world impact.
