    "text": "The Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) is excited to announce the Transport Data Minihack 2026, an event designed to foster data, coding, and reproducible research skills among ITS staff and students. This mini-hackathon provides a unique opportunity to delve into transport datasets, enhance technical abilities, and collaborate on real-world data challenges.\nScheduled for Thursday, May 7th, 2026, the event aims to create a supportive environment for participants, especially ITS MSc students working on their dissertation projects. It’s a chance to get hands-on support with importing, processing, and visualizing data, and to explore the power of data science techniques in the context of transport.\n\n\n\nSupportive Learning: Provide a space for participants to ask questions about working with datasets and applying data science techniques to transport data.\nDissertation Assistance: Offer direct support for importing datasets for MSc dissertations and other research projects.\nData Wrangling: Focus on practical skills using tools like the tidyverse R package for data manipulation.\nData Visualization: Enhance general data visualization skills and gain specific experience with various transport data types.\nOpen Science Promotion: Showcase the potential of open data (transparency, participation, research) and reproducible/open workflows.\n\n\n\n\nThe Minihack is open to all staff and students at ITS. If you are not based at the University of Leeds but are interested in participating, please contact the organizers (Robin Lovelace) for more information.\n\n\n\nThe event will feature a structured yet flexible schedule to maximize learning and collaboration:\n\n13:00 - 13:30: Introduction to importing, processing, and visualizing data with RStudio, including an overview of RStudio and Quarto for reproducible reports, and an example with origin-destination data in Leeds.\n13:30 - 14:00: Dedicated time for importing datasets and installing necessary packages, with support available for any issues.\n14:00 - 14:05: Short break.\n14:05 - 15:00: Solo working sessions on datasets, with organizers available for questions and support.\n15:15 - 15:45: Optional presentations of results, offering participants a chance to share their learnings.\n15:45 - 16:00: Networking and idea-sharing session.\n\n\n\n\nParticipants will have the opportunity to win a copy of “Geocomputation with Python” or “Geocomputation with R (second edition)”. Prizes will be awarded based on:\n\nBest technical implementation and code.\nMost creative or impactful use of data.\n\nChallenges for participants include writing code to automatically download and import datasets, subsetting data, and creating Quarto reports summarizing their analysis.\nDon’t miss this opportunity to enhance your data skills and contribute to the vibrant research community at ITS!

The theme brings together experts in data science, transport modelling, and the use of broadly-defined artificial intelligence techniques to address challenges in the transport sector. Although the focus is on new methods and technologies, our aim has an important social dimension: we believe in reducing barriers to accessing and using data and digital tools to improve transport systems for all users.\nOur work covers a range of topics, including:\n\nThe application of data science techniques to transport research questions and applications\nThe development of transport methods, models, and tools to support better decision-making\nThe use of computer vision and other machine learning techniques to extract insights from transport-related datasets\nThe use of artificial intelligence to improve transport systems"
