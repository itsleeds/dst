# Open Source Software

The [ITS Leeds GitHub organization](https://github.com/ITSLeeds) hosts numerous open source tools for transport data science. Below are some of our key packages.

## [stplanr](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr)
**Sustainable Transport Planning with R**

A package for solving common problems in transport planning and modelling, such as downloading and cleaning transport datasets, creating desire lines, and working with origin-destination data. (Hosted by rOpenSci but developed by ITS researchers).

## [pct](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct)
**Propensity to Cycle Tool Data**

Functions to access and reproduce data from the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), making the data more accessible for research and educational purposes.

## [od](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od)
**Origin-Destination Data Analysis**

An R package specifically designed for working with and manipulating origin-destination data, a core component of transport modelling.

## [UK2GTFS](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/UK2GTFS)
**Convert UK Transport Data to GTFS**

A tool to convert UK transport data formats (like TransXchange and ATOC CIF) into the standard General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format.

## [opentransportdata](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/opentransportdata)
**Open Transport Data List**

A curated list of open transport datasets for research, teaching, and development.
