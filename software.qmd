# Open Source Software

The Data Science & Technology theme at ITS develops and maintains open source software tools for transport research, planning, and analysis. Our software is freely available and supports reproducible research and practical applications.

## Key Software Projects

### Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT)
- **Website:** [www.pct.bike](https://www.pct.bike/)
- **Description:** Strategic planning tool for cycling infrastructure used across England and Wales
- **Code:** Open source R packages and web application

### Network Planning Tools for Scotland (NPT.scot)
- **Website:** [npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot/)
- **Description:** Open network planning tools for transport planning in Scotland
- **Focus:** Accessibility, active travel, and low-carbon mobility

### R Packages for Transport
Our team develops and maintains several R packages for transport data science:

#### [stplanr](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr)
**Sustainable Transport Planning with R**

A package for solving common problems in transport planning and modelling, such as downloading and cleaning transport datasets, creating desire lines, and working with origin-destination data. (Hosted by rOpenSci but developed by ITS researchers).

#### [pct](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct) ⭐ 20 stars
**Propensity to Cycle Tool Data**

Functions to access and reproduce data from the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), making the data more accessible for research and educational purposes.

#### [od](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/od) ⭐ 33 stars
**Origin-Destination Data Analysis**

An R package specifically designed for working with and manipulating origin-destination data, a core component of transport modelling.

#### [UK2GTFS](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/UK2GTFS) ⭐ 43 stars
**Convert UK Transport Data to GTFS**

A tool to convert UK transport data formats (like TransXchange and ATOC CIF) into the standard General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format.

#### [stats19](https://github.com/ropensci/stats19)
**Road Safety Data Analysis**

An R package for working with UK road collision data from the STATS19 database.

#### [osmextract](https://github.com/ropensci/osmextract)
**OpenStreetMap Data Processing**

Tools for downloading and processing OpenStreetMap data for transport analysis.

### Additional Resources

#### [opentransportdata](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/opentransportdata) ⭐ 21 stars
**Open Transport Data List**

A curated list of open transport datasets for research, teaching, and to save the world.

#### [tds](https://github.com/itsleeds/tds) ⭐ 51 stars
**Transport Data Science**

Materials for the Transport Data Science post-graduate module at the University of Leeds' Institute for Transport Studies.

#### [rrsrr](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/rrsrr) ⭐ 7 stars
**Reproducible Road Safety Research with R**

A practical user manual (book) for conducting reproducible road safety research using R.

#### [NTEM2OD](https://github.com/itsleeds/NTEM2OD) ⭐ 5 stars
**NTEM to OD Matrix Converter**

Scripts to convert the National Trip Ends Model (NTEM) into an Origin-Destination (OD) Matrix.
